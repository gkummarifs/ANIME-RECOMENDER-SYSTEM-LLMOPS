🎯 Anime Recommender System with LLM-Powered Insights

I built this Anime Recommender System to combine the best of traditional recommendation techniques with the latest large-language-model (LLM)-augmented workflows (LLMOps). The goal was to go beyond simple collaborative filtering — and add contextual, semantic, and personalized recommendations driven by AI reasoning.

Instead of just matching users to similar ratings, this system understands user preferences in natural language, creates enriched semantic embeddings for anime metadata, and delivers more intuitive, relevant recommendations.

This project is practical, modular, and designed to be a foundation for intelligent recommendation products like chat-based recommenders, AI assistants, and next-gen content discovery engines.

🧠 What the System Does

Accepts user input about anime preferences, e.g.:

“I like action anime with strong character growth and philosophical themes”

Uses LLMs to interpret the intent and highlight key aspects of the request

Leverages semantic embeddings and similarity scoring to surface:

Anime titles closely aligned with user intent

Hidden connections traditional recommendation methods may miss

Outputs a ranked list of recommendations with short natural-language explanations

This makes the system feel more human-oriented and contextually aware than typical matrix-factorization solutions.

🔍 Why I Built This

In many real-world systems, recommendations often fall short because:

They rely strictly on numeric ratings and co-occurrence

They cannot interpret rich, descriptive user desires

They miss nuanced semantic relationships between titles

By integrating LLM reasoning with embeddings and recommender logic, I built a system that better understands why someone likes something — not just that they liked it.

This aligns with modern AI product trends:

conversational recommenders

personalized discovery

semantic search & retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

🚀 Key Technical Features

Natural Language Preference Input
Users express likes/dislikes in plain English, not rigid filters.

Embedding-Driven Similarity Search
Anime titles are transformed into vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

LLM Refinement Layer
A language model interprets user intent and enhances similarity signals.

Modular Pipeline (LLMOps-ready)
Designed to support:

retraining

dynamic updates

prompt optimization

logging & evaluation

Explainable Recommendations
Each suggestion includes human-readable context describing why it fits the user’s preference.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python — core language

LLMs / Embeddings — for semantic understanding

Vector similarity search engine — for nearest-neighbor lookup

Optional UI integration (e.g., Streamlit) — for interactive demos

💼 What This Shows to Hiring Managers

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Build hybrid AI systems that combine traditional methods with LLM reasoning

Apply NLP and embeddings to derive semantic insight

Design user-centric AI features beyond raw metrics

Think about modularity, scalability, and real-world usage

Bridge gaps between data science, AI/ML, and product value

It reflects how I approach AI engineering — focusing on utility, user experience, extensibility, and real impact rather than experiments that stop at prototyping.

📈 Possible Extensions

Future improvements could include:

Personalized fine­tuning on user feedback

Adaptive UI with conversational explanations

Multi-modal input (images, trailers, ratings)

Real-time scoring updates
